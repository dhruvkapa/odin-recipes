    <p>This chard taco recipe is bound to make you want more. A light fluffy tortilla along with taco filling seems too good to be true, but it's all yours!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, cut into 1/4 inch slices</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes, or as per taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 bunch Swiss chard, tough stems removed and leaves cut crosswise into 1 and 1/2 inch slices</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>12 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1 cup crumbled quesco fresco cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup salsa</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes, stirring until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the chicken broth, Swiss chard, and salt. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until chard is nearly tender, about 5 minutes. Remove lid and increase heat to medium, stirring until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat another skillet over medium-high heat. Warm the tortillas in the skillet for about 1 minute per side. Fill the warmed tortillas with the chard, and top with the queso fresco cheese and salsa.</li>
    </ol>
